## Papers
Paper: [Off-the-Grid MARL: Datasets with Baselines for Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00521)

Code: [instadeepai/og-marl](https://github.com/instadeepai/og-marl)

Profile: This paper introduces OG-MARL, a dataset and benchmarking tool specifically designed for offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). It aims to address the lack of standardized datasets and benchmarks in the offline MARL field to drive progress in this area. OG-MARL offers a collection of high-quality datasets featuring complex environment dynamics, multi-agent heterogeneity, partial observability, sparse rewards, and other characteristics that provide benchmarks for evaluating the performance of offline MARL algorithms.
